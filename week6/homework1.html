                <p>On 30 December 2016 New Era was upgraded to University College status by the Ministry of Higher
                    Education. This upgrading allows New Era University College to confer its own degrees and
                    post-graduate degrees. Three faculties were thereupon formed out of existing departments and
                    entrusted to develop and introduce new degree courses. At the same time diploma courses
                    continued to be offered. These diploma courses while preparing graduates for a working career
                    also serve as a pathway to degree courses in New Era and in partner overseas universities.</p>

                    unwavering support from the Malaysian Chinese community.</p>
